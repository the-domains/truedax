            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Career makeover: From ops to devops</h1><p>Long ago, in a IT operations model far, far away, businesses built their data centers. Rows and rows of server racks humming away in closets tangled with cables -- that was IT's lifeblood. It was a time when virtualization meant that thing a couple of gung-ho admins toyed with on an old HP DL360 server destined for the garbage bin.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7524aa25306f375e974afa30d4f0337cce5ca315.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Don't be fooled by the crafty look-and-feel of Etsy.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/82205ac18e1007767b2377aa3e75b1350446017b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>SecOps: Put security in DevOps first, not as an add-on</h1><p>Most people don't think about security when it comes to DevOps, but the process involves many vulnerabilities. Data at rest and in flight is left unencrypted in many cases. Moreover, role-based security is often tossed out the window to allow for faster production. In this article, I'll explore the critical issues with DevOps security.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ecc21a6ee02daadf25649bfa7a6a3664191e04af.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The 13 developer skills you need to master now</h1><p>Heavy weighs the crown of the developer king. Yes, as software eats the world, demand for skilled developers remains high. But software's pervasiveness -- from the server to the cloud to the coming onslaught of wearable and IoT devices -- means far greater responsibilities for software engineers and the need to constantly expand your skills.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04e2b75c59e6f006470d6218fb9d1d70720cb624.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DevOps principles for IT managers</h1><p>DevOps isn't a fixed methodology or process; it's a community of practice and a set of principles. DevOps advocates Damon Edwards and John Willis described DevOps in 2010 with the acronym CAMS: culture, automation, measurement and sharing. Here's a quick overview of these core elements of DevOps and why they're so important for IT managers who want to build an effective DevOps organization.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a3fda666805ae50311066a593365c0717050b67d.png"></article>]]></description>
