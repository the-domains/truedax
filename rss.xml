            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DevOps and the Myth of Efficiency, Part I</h1><p>This post is for those of you working in large companies or "enterprises" and are exploring what "DevOps" really means and why you're struggling with it. I've decided to split this into a two-part post to make it easy to digest some of the thoughts here; I suspect I'll be writing a lot here and build upon some of my other posts.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/496354fb1c720dec51914a617ad1d8e701295f42.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3 hottest cloud job skills for 2016</h1><p>I get this a lot: People approach me at conferences and ask about the hottest cloud skills. Why? Because they want to learn more, declare their expertise, and get a new and higher-paying gig. I can't blame them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/87b19a7b8888bad8b9af5d03d22c4c5cc3470686.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DEVOPSdigest</h1><p>I love the Bourne movies. Apart from the action, what I find fascinating is the uncanny abilities of the protagonist - Jason Bourne; his sixth-sense. He can quickly "weigh up" his surroundings and make detailed assessments of all dangers. This acute level of awareness gives him a distinct competitive advantage.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/21345722a0cdec3f5992eecbee59850500c69e46.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Human Brains Are Wired to Blame Rather Than Praise</h1><p>Ouch! Did you do that on purpose? Psychologists have long concluded that people tend to judge others more harshly for their negative actions-assigning fault and blame more often than praise or accolades. Now we know why. New research shows the human brain is wired to react more emotionally to the bad things people do.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/167eef2a56845b024f67a17dd4e1a0af3aa5171a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
