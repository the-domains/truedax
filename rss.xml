This week, we'll use CloudFormation to provision ACM certificates automatically. I built my own custom ACM resource in Python. With this resource, you can configure a CloudFront distribution for your static content and get a custom SSL for your domain.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Containers as a Service (CaaS) as your new platform for application development and operations</h1><p>Developers don't adopt locked down platforms.
