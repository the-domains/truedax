            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What Developers Want From Their Technology (But Mostly Cloud)</h1><p>In this article, the author looks at why developers adopt software. Instead of bombarding people with new features, successful software providers recognize that choice + speed + simplicity = adoption. The author proposes that software/cloud providers that offer simple interfaces in rapidly delivered software win out against more thoughtfully-integrated, feature-rich alternatives.</p><img src="http://cdn.infoq.com/statics_s2_20160209-0057/resource/articles/what-developers-want-from-cloud/en/resources/devs1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

What is good Ops hygiene? It's not as simple as keeping up with the laundry, but the idea is similar. It means that we're not going to get surprised by something in our environment that we'd taken for granted.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5cf7dbfd157e619b70ec39ee5b9effbc3a055fad.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sourcing Security Superheroes: Part II: How Policy Can Enhance, Rather Than Hinder, Breach Detection</h1><p>With the recent attacks on U.S. organizations in the commercial and public sectors, many companies have asserted they have done everything in their power to prevent further incidents. Most of these claims are tied to adherence to regulatory compliance. In theory, security policies put standards in place to protect organizations, stakeholders, and users.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/38faa62417cb032a5ff74c894e34c3dcac1d543e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
