            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can DevOps and ITIL co-exist? A story of two IT service philosophies: | ZDNet</h1><p>Can ITIL and DevOps co-exist? That's the question recently put forth by Gareth Daine, who quizzed some 25 industry experts and observers on whether the two methodologies clash, or are compatible. ITIL, originally known as Information Technology Infrastructure Library, is a set of best practices which recognize and certify that IT functions are delivered as tangible services to organizations.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d389adb0be084d14f241a7f688b943870a6db46b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Bulletproof DevOps Strategy to Ensure Success in the Cloud</h1><p>DevOps and cloud computing are linked. This fact is well understood by organizations that stand up SaaS clouds or build applications in the cloud. The core component of this relationship is value through agility.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Netflix Tech Blog: How We Build Code at Netflix</h1><p>How does Netflix build code before it's deployed to the cloud?

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Go DevOps before your bosses force you to. It'll be easier that way</h1><p>Some people are making very bold claims about what DevOps can deliver. Here's one: "High-performing IT organizations deploy 30x more frequently with 200x shorter lead times; they have 60x fewer failures and recover 168x faster," according to the first bullet point of the 2015 annual Puppet Labs State of DevOps report.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dd8903f2377fba503a3c601650b28a727a91f378.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Who Needs GitHub? Run GitLab on a USB Stick with Docker</h1><p>I use Git for everything. Some of those things aren't public (like books and courses I'm writing which are in-progress), and even when they are public I often work without Internet access. So I can't push changes to GitHub, but I don't want them stranded on my laptop.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/313904f5daba4eea32e44f968575dd8e8611c9ea.png"></article>]]></description>
