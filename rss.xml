            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Go DevOps before your bosses force you to. It'll be easier that way</h1><p>Some people are making very bold claims about what DevOps can deliver. Here's one: "High-performing IT organizations deploy 30x more frequently with 200x shorter lead times; they have 60x fewer failures and recover 168x faster," according to the first bullet point of the 2015 annual Puppet Labs State of DevOps report.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dd8903f2377fba503a3c601650b28a727a91f378.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Who Needs GitHub? Run GitLab on a USB Stick with Docker</h1><p>I use Git for everything. Some of those things aren't public (like books and courses I'm writing which are in-progress), and even when they are public I often work without Internet access. So I can't push changes to GitHub, but I don't want them stranded on my laptop.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/313904f5daba4eea32e44f968575dd8e8611c9ea.png"></article>]]></description>
