            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Etsy CTO Q&A: We Need Software Engineers, Not Developers - The New Stack</h1><p>When it comes to the practice of DevOps, few companies have been on the cutting edge as long as Etsy, which once famously asserted that its new engineer hires would commit code to production after the first day of work. Don't be fooled by the crafty look-and-feel of Etsy.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/82205ac18e1007767b2377aa3e75b1350446017b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Docker Networking Design Philosophy</h1><p>From the experimental networking in Docker 1.7 to the initial release in Docker 1.9, the reception from the community has been fantastic! First of all we want to thank you for all the discussions, evaluations, PRs and filed issues. As the networking capabilities evolving with every release, we wanted to spend some time explaining the guiding principles behind the design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/64c542b3952e88243e5265f52c4e023e0136c674.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>SecOps: Put security in DevOps first, not as an add-on</h1><p>Most people don't think about security when it comes to DevOps, but the process involves many vulnerabilities. Data at rest and in flight is left unencrypted in many cases. Moreover, role-based security is often tossed out the window to allow for faster production. In this article, I'll explore the critical issues with DevOps security.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ecc21a6ee02daadf25649bfa7a6a3664191e04af.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The 13 developer skills you need to master now</h1><p>Heavy weighs the crown of the developer king. Yes, as software eats the world, demand for skilled developers remains high. But software's pervasiveness -- from the server to the cloud to the coming onslaught of wearable and IoT devices -- means far greater responsibilities for software engineers and the need to constantly expand your skills.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04e2b75c59e6f006470d6218fb9d1d70720cb624.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Securing the Modern Software Delivery Lifecycle</h1><p>Information security practice has evolved to be pretty good at granting and managing access to confidential information - by people.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DevOps principles for IT managers</h1><p>DevOps isn't a fixed methodology or process; it's a community of practice and a set of principles. DevOps advocates Damon Edwards and John Willis described DevOps in 2010 with the acronym CAMS: culture, automation, measurement and sharing. Here's a quick overview of these core elements of DevOps and why they're so important for IT managers who want to build an effective DevOps organization.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a3fda666805ae50311066a593365c0717050b67d.png"></article>]]></description>
