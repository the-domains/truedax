            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Connections: DevOps initiatives shouldn't just touch the new stuff</h1><p>Although I feel as if it's been dispelled to a significant degree, there lingers the misperception that DevOps [1] is mostly for companies that sport ping-pong tables and have free sushi for lunch.

With most CM tools providing support for Docker, the consensus seems to be to use both CM and containers in tandem for without ditching one in favor of the other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dadff9d458f25d696dd30a94a780fd774e27df81.jpg"></article>]]></description>
