            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Connections: DevOps initiatives shouldn't just touch the new stuff</h1><p>Although I feel as if it's been dispelled to a significant degree, there lingers the misperception that DevOps [1] is mostly for companies that sport ping-pong tables and have free sushi for lunch. Firms that manufacture construction equipment and have large swaths of legacy computer code? Not so much.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d4173124f511779673f0ded82818cfb2c97183a3.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Role of Configuration Management in a Containerized World</h1><p>Docker has seen widespread adoption as an infrastructure automation tool and there has been a growing debate as to whether it supersedes configuration management (CM) tools. With most CM tools providing support for Docker, the consensus seems to be to use both CM and containers in tandem for without ditching one in favor of the other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dadff9d458f25d696dd30a94a780fd774e27df81.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is VMware Building a DevOps Framework for the Masses?</h1><p>While Cloud Native Applications and DevOps are generating massive amounts of hype, the ability of IT organizations to execute on this vision outside of Silicon Valley is often being questioned. VMware's Cloud-Native Apps group is putting together an infrastructure framework that might just be the right model to bring DevOps interactions to the masses.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/49ec4cf320270dd98bfe34aa65cc62fae09b43d2.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DevOps and the Myth of Efficiency, Part I</h1><p>This post is for those of you working in large companies or "enterprises" and are exploring what "DevOps" really means and why you're struggling with it. I've decided to split this into a two-part post to make it easy to digest some of the thoughts here; I suspect I'll be writing a lot here and build upon some of my other posts.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1d85d1c3acc2b122d048e24954819b16fe99e5c8.png"></article>]]></description>

Because they want to learn more, declare their expertise, and get a new and higher-paying gig. I can't blame them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/582eb066f4f6c14e3055ad3d37c6fc1fa59696ab.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DEVOPSdigest</h1><p>I love the Bourne movies. Apart from the action, what I find fascinating is the uncanny abilities of the protagonist - Jason Bourne; his sixth-sense. He can quickly "weigh up" his surroundings and make detailed assessments of all dangers. This acute level of awareness gives him a distinct competitive advantage.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d53522f1992d86255e92c65a4fd123b27b4a4a75.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Human Brains Are Wired to Blame Rather Than Praise</h1><p>Ouch! Did you do that on purpose? Psychologists have long concluded that people tend to judge others more harshly for their negative actions-assigning fault and blame more often than praise or accolades. Now we know why. New research shows the human brain is wired to react more emotionally to the bad things people do.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0585c00ff792e0b11a17ca7bf5ded0a77c281fa9.jpg"></article>]]></description>
