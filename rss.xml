            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An Orchestrated Puppet Infrastucture with Docker and Rancher - Camptocamp</h1><p>Docker is changing the face of code packaging, delivery and infrastructure. While we have used Docker heavily for testing purposes for over a year now, using it to host production is yet another step. For us at Camptocamp, we seized that opportunity to move our whole Puppet infrastructure on top of Docker, with the help of the Rancher orchestrator.</p><img src="http://www.camptocamp.com/wp-content/uploads/puppet-rancher_150-550x354.png"></article>]]></description>

That's the question recently put forth by Gareth Daine, who quizzed some 25 industry experts and observers on whether the two methodologies clash, or are compatible.
