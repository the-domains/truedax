            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DEVOPSdigest</h1><p>I love the Bourne movies. Apart from the action, what I find fascinating is the uncanny abilities of the protagonist - Jason Bourne; his sixth-sense. He can quickly "weigh up" his surroundings and make detailed assessments of all dangers. This acute level of awareness gives him a distinct competitive advantage.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/21345722a0cdec3f5992eecbee59850500c69e46.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Human Brains Are Wired to Blame Rather Than Praise</h1><p>Ouch! Did you do that on purpose? Psychologists have long concluded that people tend to judge others more harshly for their negative actions-assigning fault and blame more often than praise or accolades. Now we know why. New research shows the human brain is wired to react more emotionally to the bad things people do.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/167eef2a56845b024f67a17dd4e1a0af3aa5171a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
