            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Career makeover: From ops to devops</h1><p>Long ago, in a IT operations model far, far away, businesses built their data centers. Rows and rows of server racks humming away in closets tangled with cables -- that was IT's lifeblood. It was a time when virtualization meant that thing a couple of gung-ho admins toyed with on an old HP DL360 server destined for the garbage bin.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7524aa25306f375e974afa30d4f0337cce5ca315.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>SecOps: Put security in DevOps first, not as an add-on</h1><p>Most people don't think about security when it comes to DevOps, but the process involves many vulnerabilities. Data at rest and in flight is left unencrypted in many cases. Moreover, role-based security is often tossed out the window to allow for faster production. In this article, I'll explore the critical issues with DevOps security.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ecc21a6ee02daadf25649bfa7a6a3664191e04af.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Yes, as software eats the world, demand for skilled developers remains high.
