            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DevOps workers, you mother was right: always bring a clean Underlay.</h1><p>Why did your mom care about underwear? She wanted you to have good hygiene. What is good Ops hygiene? It's not as simple as keeping up with the laundry, but the idea is similar. It means that we're not going to get surprised by something in our environment that we'd taken for granted.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5cf7dbfd157e619b70ec39ee5b9effbc3a055fad.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sourcing Security Superheroes: Part II: How Policy Can Enhance, Rather Than Hinder, Breach Detection</h1><p>With the recent attacks on U.S. organizations in the commercial and public sectors, many companies have asserted they have done everything in their power to prevent further incidents. Most of these claims are tied to adherence to regulatory compliance. In theory, security policies put standards in place to protect organizations, stakeholders, and users.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/38faa62417cb032a5ff74c894e34c3dcac1d543e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Be My Business Valentine? Romancing with DevOps</h1><p>Building a Technology Trust Nest It's no surprise that Dev and Ops teams don't always get along. In one area, developers crank out code and play with all their new toys, while over in the Network Operations Center (NOC), IT operations teams are cursing behind monitoring consoles and dealing with the fall-out when defect-ridden software comes over the wall.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/45268742b08e3eaec453b33ad2cac5abfc9755ab.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DevOps tools best practices: A 7-step guide</h1><p>Most developers have moved beyond understanding the business value of DevOps and on to how best to implement it.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Containers as a Service (CaaS) as your new platform for application development and operations</h1><p>Developers don't adopt locked down platforms. That one simple statement summarizes decades of tension between IT operations and development teams. Along the spectrum of control versus agility are the desires and needs of IT operations teams responsible for keeping environments up and running and compliant to regulations and the needs of developers who are responsible for building software to attract, engage and maintain customers.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b3f3de2e71323bf56db85e3c396994fa4e3d387a.png"></article>]]></description>
