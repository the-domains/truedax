            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DevOps principles for IT managers</h1><p>DevOps isn't a fixed methodology or process; it's a community of practice and a set of principles. DevOps advocates Damon Edwards and John Willis described DevOps in 2010 with the acronym CAMS: culture, automation, measurement and sharing. Here's a quick overview of these core elements of DevOps and why they're so important for IT managers who want to build an effective DevOps organization.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a3fda666805ae50311066a593365c0717050b67d.png"></article>]]></description>
