            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Structured logging with Filebeat</h1><p>The idea behind structured logging is simple: instead of having applications write logs that need to be parsed via regular expressions into JSON objects that you index into Elasticsearch, you make the application write JSON objects directly. To exemplify, let's say you are writing a Python web application, and you are using the standard library for logging.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fbd6f0cb9145fc51636119c0319c26eba4e43673.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Continuous Deployment at Instagram</h1><p>At Instagram, we deploy our backend code 30-50 times a day... whenever engineers commit changes to master... with no human involvement in most cases.

In trying to implement the latest breakfast cereal agenda, DevOps, one of the primary chumming tasks is dealing with all your "pre-DevOps" software and services.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/10e43ce3c57ea793c28d2308cabca7938a994285.jpg"></article>]]></description>
