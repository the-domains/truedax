            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Software automation and AI in DevOps aren't the fast track to Skynet</h1><p>Software automation is becoming intelligent, going deep into systems and is even going "autonomic" and helping create self-healing systems. If we engineer too much automation into our new notion of intelligently provisioned DevOps, then are we at risk of breaking the Internet and causing global nuclear meltdown?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4c833952ad8b22a57a52d40dc852180ab08f4d36.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An Orchestrated Puppet Infrastucture with Docker and Rancher - Camptocamp</h1><p>Docker is changing the face of code packaging, delivery and infrastructure. While we have used Docker heavily for testing purposes for over a year now, using it to host production is yet another step. For us at Camptocamp, we seized that opportunity to move our whole Puppet infrastructure on top of Docker, with the help of the Rancher orchestrator.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5d17a420df385c1987c9a4145244594e099a107c.png"></article>]]></description>
