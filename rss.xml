            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The next evolution of enterprise devops is to harden it</h1><p>In today's digital age, business innovation is largely driven by software. To win, serve, and retain their customers, enterprises must release application updates at an increasingly faster pace. A great idea, killer functionality and a robust technology are all as important as ever, but they don't mean much if you can't get your code to your end users in a fast, predictable manner with high quality.</p><img src="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2016/03/itproportal-100653307-primary.idge.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Linux is so grown up, it's ready for marriage with containers</h1><p>Linux is all grown up. It has nothing left to prove. There's never been a year of the Linux desktop and there probably never will be, but it runs on the majority of the world's servers. It never took over the desktop, it did an end-run around it: there are more Linux-based client devices accessing those servers than there are Windows boxes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/60e90f515bf5eef83d0362a121bcdecafca63f2e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Software automation and AI in DevOps aren't the fast track to Skynet</h1><p>Software automation is becoming intelligent, going deep into systems and is even going "autonomic" and helping create self-healing systems. If we engineer too much automation into our new notion of intelligently provisioned DevOps, then are we at risk of breaking the Internet and causing global nuclear meltdown?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4c833952ad8b22a57a52d40dc852180ab08f4d36.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An Orchestrated Puppet Infrastucture with Docker and Rancher - Camptocamp</h1><p>Docker is changing the face of code packaging, delivery and infrastructure. While we have used Docker heavily for testing purposes for over a year now, using it to host production is yet another step. For us at Camptocamp, we seized that opportunity to move our whole Puppet infrastructure on top of Docker, with the help of the Rancher orchestrator.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5d17a420df385c1987c9a4145244594e099a107c.png"></article>]]></description>

That's the question recently put forth by Gareth Daine, who quizzed some 25 industry experts and observers on whether the two methodologies clash, or are compatible.
