            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Be My Business Valentine? Romancing with DevOps</h1><p>Building a Technology Trust Nest It's no surprise that Dev and Ops teams don't always get along. In one area, developers crank out code and play with all their new toys, while over in the Network Operations Center (NOC), IT operations teams are cursing behind monitoring consoles and dealing with the fall-out when defect-ridden software comes over the wall.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/45268742b08e3eaec453b33ad2cac5abfc9755ab.png"></article>]]></description>
