            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Improving Build Time of Java Builds on OpenShift - OpenShift Blog</h1><p>Since we released OpenShift 3 back in July 2015, one of the most common questions I get from developers is how to get better build time for Java based builds. In this post, I will guide you through the process of speeding up Java Maven based builds, and will explain other options that can be taken to the ones that I'll be showing.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/85ce7bc47f6898272c712d6f639f1a912aa2accd.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Foundations of DevOps</h1><p>Debates about what DevOps is have been going on for several years. However, rather than being a static entity, with a single definition, DevOps may be closer to a practice, with some underlying principles that remain constant, and with forms and applications that vary according to the experiences of the practitioners.</p></article>]]></description>

This is the process of getting developers and sysadmins working together closely on the same team to support a company's custom-written software.
