            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>IT managers: we're hurting for more cloud and DevOps skills | ZDNet</h1><p>There's been a lot of talk lately about " two-speed" IT, in which one part of the job is to help with all the cool stuff, such as digital presence and data analytics, while the other part is to deal with the traditional IT maintenance stuff -- upgrades, patching, coding, security and so forth.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/66b8e2a91b5dfbfdfdc23700ba414ed5fd1d8071.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Working together makes both teams, Dev & Ops, better, and helps the company and community thrive. We now need to broaden the scope of DevOps and embrace another responsibility - Security. Web Security is fundamentally broken right now, operating from the outside and vastly understaffed.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6ed407512862788076107cdd20376273cb7ad146.jpg"></article>]]></description>
