description: 'In this article, the author looks at why developers adopt software. Instead of bombarding people with new features, successful software providers recognize that choice + speed + simplicity = adoption. The author proposes that software/cloud providers that offer simple interfaces in rapidly delivered software win out against more thoughtfully-integrated, feature-rich alternatives.'
