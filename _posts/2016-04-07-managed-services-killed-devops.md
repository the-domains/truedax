description: "DevOps, as we know it, is dead. Perhaps not many people agree with me, but the age of DevOps is just about over. Then again, perhaps this won't come as a surprise to some. While certain industries somehow manage to survive for years - decades, perhaps - without needing to make fundamental changes, that's absolutely not the case in the software world."
