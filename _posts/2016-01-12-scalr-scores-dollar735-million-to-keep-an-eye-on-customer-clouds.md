description: "Scalr, which made its name monitoring the performance of multiple clouds for business customers, just raised $7.35 million in new funding from OpenView Venture Partners. While Amazon is the big daddy in public clouds-which pool tons of computer, networking, and storage to rent out to customers-many companies don't want to put all their jobs in one cloud basket."
