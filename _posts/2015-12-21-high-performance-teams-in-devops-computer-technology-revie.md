description: "by Kris Bliesner The secret to DevOps maturity isn't technology or process, but people. It takes engaged leadership and all-for-one cooperation to achieve the kind of results that lead companies to superior IT performance. High-performing DevOps teams can recover 168 times faster from failures and have 60 times fewer failures due to changes, according to the 2015 State of DevOps report by Puppet Labs."
